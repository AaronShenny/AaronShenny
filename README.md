Hi, I’m Aaron Shenny.

I mostly live in the backend world. I started coding with Python, then moved into backend web development using Node.js and Django. I don’t really enjoy frontend work — I like working behind the scenes, dealing with logic, APIs, and how things connect.

These days, I’m exploring AI-related stuff. I play around with APIs, automate things, and experiment with AI agents and workflows. I enjoy breaking things, fixing them, and figuring out how systems actually work.

**What I usually work on:**
- Backend development with Python and Node.js  
- APIs, integrations, and automation  
- AI-powered tools, agents, and experiments  

**Some projects I’ve worked on:**
- **eventAgent** – a multi-agent AI system for discovering campus events  
- **Pixora** – image similarity and face-based categorization  
- **ObjectEye** - image recognisation 

I’m still exploring and learning, but my focus is on building solid backend systems and AI-powered workflows that actually do something useful, actually that saves my and our time.
